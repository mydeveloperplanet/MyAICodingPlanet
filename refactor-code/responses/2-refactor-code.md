### Review of `Refactor.processMessage(RefactorMessage refactorMessage)`

#### 1. Code Style and Adherence to Best Practices

**Issue:** The method is quite long and complex, making it difficult to read and understand.

**Fix:** Break down the method into smaller, more manageable methods. For example:
- Extract the logic for determining `isMultiData` into a separate method.
- Extract the logic for finding data from the repository into a separate method.
- Extract the logic for parsing messages into separate methods.

**Rationale:** Smaller methods are easier to test, debug, and maintain.

#### 2. Potential Bugs or Edge Cases Not Handled

**Issue:** The method does not handle cases where `refactorMessage` is `null`.

**Fix:** Add a null check at the beginning of the method.

```java
if (refactorMessage == null) {
    logger.error("RefactorMessage is null");
    return;
}
```

**Rationale:** Handling null inputs prevents potential `NullPointerExceptions`.

#### 3. Performance Optimizations

**Issue:** The method uses `substring` to parse the occurrence time, which can be inefficient.

**Fix:** Use a more efficient parsing method, such as `DateTimeFormatter`.

```java
Instant occurrenceTime = Instant.parse(refactorMessage.getOccurrenceTime(), DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"));
```

**Rationale:** Using built-in methods for date parsing is generally more efficient and easier to read.

#### 4. Security Vulnerabilities

**Issue:** The method does not validate the input data, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

**Fix:** Add validation checks for all input parameters.

```java
if (refactorMessage.getOccurrenceTime() == null || !refactorMessage.getOccurrenceTime().matches("\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2} \\d{2}:\\d{2}")) {
    logger.error("Invalid occurrence time format");
    return;
}
```

**Rationale:** Validating input data helps prevent security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.

#### 5. Readability and Maintainability

**Issue:** The method has a lot of conditional logic, making it difficult to follow the flow of execution.

**Fix:** Use early returns to simplify the code.

```java
if (refactorMessage.getSingleData() != null) {
    id = refactorMessage.getSingleDataId();
} else {
    id = refactorMessage.getMultiDataId();
    isMultiData = true;
}

// Early return if repository call fails
try {
    if (isMultiData) {
        multiDataDto = dataRepository.findMultiData(id);
    } else {
        singleDataDto = dataRepository.findSingleData(id);
    }
} catch (RepositoryException e) {
    logger.error("Connection with repository failed id: {}", id, e);
    return;
}
```

**Rationale:** Early returns make the code easier to read and understand.

### Overall Improvements or Refactoring Suggestions

1. **Use Enums for Data Types:** Instead of using strings to represent data types, consider using enums to improve type safety and readability.
2. **Separate Concerns:** Consider separating concerns by creating separate classes for different message parsing logic (e.g., `SingleDataParser`, `MultiDataParser`).
3. **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for each method to ensure they work as expected under various conditions.

By following these suggestions, the code will be more maintainable, readable, and less prone to bugs.
