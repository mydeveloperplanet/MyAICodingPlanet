The selected Spring Scheduling cron expression `0 */15 * * * *` is a time-based trigger that specifies when to execute a scheduled task. Let's break down the components of this cron expression:

- **Seconds**: `0`
    - The task will run at the start of each minute (i.e., every second is set to `0`).

- **Minutes**: `*/15`
    - This means the task will run every 15 minutes. Specifically, it will run at the following times: 00, 15, 30, and 45 minutes past the hour.

- **Hours**: `*`
    - The task will run every hour of the day.

- **Day of Month**: `*`
    - The task will run every day of the month.

- **Month**: `*`
    - The task will run every month.

- **Day of Week**: `*`
    - The task will run every day of the week.

In summary, this cron expression schedules a task to run at the start of each minute for every hour on every day of the year.
