The selected text `0 */15 * * * *` is a cron expression. Cron expressions are used to schedule tasks (like running scripts or sending emails) at specific times.

Here's a breakdown of the cron expression:

- `0`: This specifies the minute. In this case, it's set to 0, meaning the task will run at the start of every hour.
- `*/15`: This specifies the hour. The asterisk (`*`) means "every," and `*/15` means "every 15 minutes." So, this part of the expression is not valid because cron expressions expect a specific time or range for hours.
- `*`: This specifies the day of the month. An asterisk means "every day."
- `*`: This specifies the month. An asterisk means "every month."
- `*`: This specifies the day of the week. An asterisk means "every day."

To make this a valid cron expression, you would need to specify a specific time for hours. For example:

```
0 15 * * *
```

This would mean the task will run at 3:00 PM every day.

If you meant to schedule something that runs every 15 minutes, you might want to use a different approach, such as a loop in a script or a scheduled job that checks for tasks every 15 minutes.
