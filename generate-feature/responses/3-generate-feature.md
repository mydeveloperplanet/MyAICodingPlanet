This error occurs because Hibernate cannot find the `owner` property in the `Pet` class. Looking at the code, I notice that the `Pet` class is imported from `org.springframework.samples.petclinic.owner.Pet` in the `PetRepository`, but there seems to be no explicit owner relationship defined in the `Pet` class.

Here's how to fix this:

1. First, modify the `Pet` class to include the owner relationship:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "pets")
public class Pet extends NamedEntity {

    @Column(name = "birth_date")
    @DateTimeFormat(pattern = "yyyy-MM-dd")
    private LocalDate birthDate;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "owner_id")
    private Owner owner;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "type_id")
    private PetType type;

    // Add getter and setter for owner
    public Owner getOwner() {
        return owner;
    }

    public void setOwner(Owner owner) {
        this.owner = owner;
    }

    // ... rest of the existing code
}
```

2. Then, update the query in `PetRepository.java` to ensure it uses the correct join:

```java
public interface PetRepository extends Repository<Pet, Integer> {

    @Query("SELECT DISTINCT pet FROM Pet pet LEFT JOIN FETCH pet.owner WHERE LOWER(pet.name) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT('%', :name, '%'))")
    Page<Pet> findByNameContainingIgnoreCase(String name, Pageable pageable);

}
```

The key changes are:

1. Added the `@ManyToOne` relationship to the `Pet` class to properly map the owner relationship
2. Added the `@JoinColumn` annotation to specify the foreign key column
3. Added getter and setter methods for the owner property

This should resolve the Hibernate error as it will now be able to find and properly map the owner relationship in the Pet entity.

The error occurred because the JPQL query was trying to join with `pet.owner`, but the `owner` property wasn't properly defined in the `Pet` entity class. By adding the proper JPA annotations and the owner field, we establish the relationship that the query expects.
