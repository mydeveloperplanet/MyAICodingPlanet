The error you're encountering is due to the fact that Spring Boot is unable to determine a suitable JDBC driver class for your database connection. This typically happens when the necessary dependencies are not included in your project or when the configuration is incorrect.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the PostgreSQL JDBC driver dependency is included in your `pom.xml` (if you're using Maven) or `build.gradle` (if you're using Gradle). Additionally, make sure that the database URL, username, and password are correctly configured in your application properties or YAML file.

Here's how you can add the PostgreSQL JDBC driver dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

If you're using Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    testImplementation 'org.postgresql:postgresql'
}
```

Next, ensure that your application properties or YAML file contains the correct database configuration. For example, in `application.properties`, it should look something like this:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/testdb
spring.datasource.username=testuser
spring.datasource.password=testpass
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
```

If you're using Testcontainers, make sure that the PostgreSQL container is correctly set up and started before running your tests. Here's an example of how you can configure it:

```java
import org.testcontainers.containers.PostgreSQLContainer;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.ServiceConnection;

@SpringBootTest
public class CustomerRepositoryTest {

    @Container
    @ServiceConnection(name = "testdb", driverClassName = "org.postgresql.Driver")
    public static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgreSQLContainer = new PostgreSQLContainer<>("postgres:latest")
            .withDatabaseName("testdb")
            .withUsername("testuser")
            .withPassword("testpass");

    // Your test methods here
}
```

By ensuring that the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is included and the database configuration is correct, you should be able to resolve the `Failed to determine a suitable driver class` error.
