# My AI Coding Planet

This repository contains examples how you can practically use AI within your coding workflow.

As a coding assistant, [DevoxxGenie](https://github.com/devoxx/DevoxxGenieIDEAPlugin) is used. 

More information about DevoxxGenie can be found at a previous [blog](https://mydeveloperplanet.com/2024/10/08/devoxxgenie-your-ai-assistant-for-idea/)

Two different setups are used, in every README the used setup is mentioned.
1. [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) as inference engine and qwen2.5-coder:7b as a model is used. This runs on CPU only.
2. [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/) as inference engine and qwen2.5-coder:7b as a model is used. This runs on GPU only.
