# Review Code

AI can be very helpful during code reviews. Take this [db.yml](sources/db.yml) which is a Kubernetes deployment file taken from the [Spring Petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/blob/main/k8s/db.yml)

When you take a look at this file, you can see some issues with it:
* the secret is hardcoded
* no resource limits are added
* the liveness and readiness probes are not quite ok

## Setup
Ollama, qwen2.5-coder, CPU

## Prompt
Open the db.yml file and use the following prompt
```text
/review
```
This expands to the following prompt.
```text
Review the selected code, can it be improved or are there any bugs?
```

## Response

The provided YAML configuration for a PostgreSQL database in Kubernetes looks mostly correct and well-structured. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made:

1. **Resource Limits**: It's a good practice to set resource limits (CPU and memory) for the container to ensure it doesn't consume excessive resources.

2. **Readiness and Liveness Probes**: The current probes are using `tcpSocket`, which checks if the port is open but does not verify that the database is ready or responsive. Consider using a more sophisticated probe like an HTTP GET request to check the database status.

3. **Secret Management**: While the secrets are correctly referenced, it might be beneficial to use environment variables for sensitive information instead of directly embedding them in the YAML file.

4. **Documentation and Comments**: Adding comments to explain each section of the YAML can make it easier for others (and future you) to understand the configuration.

Here is an improved version of your YAML with these suggestions:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: demo-db
type: servicebinding.io/postgresql
stringData:
  type: "postgresql"
  provider: "postgresql"
  host: "demo-db"
  port: "5432"
  database: "petclinic"
  username: "user"
  password: "pass"

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

  name: demo-db
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 5432
  selector:
    app: demo-db

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo-db
  labels:
    app: demo-db
spec:
  replicas: 1  # Ensure you have a replica for high availability
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo-db
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo-db
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: postgres:17
          name: postgresql
          env:
            - name: POSTGRES_USER
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: demo-db
                  key: username
            - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: demo-db
                  key: password
            - name: POSTGRES_DB
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: demo-db
                  key: database
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
              name: postgresql
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "64Mi"
              cpu: "250m"
            limits:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 5432
              initialDelaySeconds: 30
              periodSeconds: 10
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 5432
              initialDelaySeconds: 30
              periodSeconds: 10
          startupProbe:
            tcpSocket:
              port: postgresql
              initialDelaySeconds: 10
              periodSeconds: 10
```

### Key Improvements:
- **Resource Limits**: Added `resources` section to set memory and CPU limits.
- **Readiness and Liveness Probes**: Changed from `tcpSocket` to `httpGet` for a more robust check.
- **Replicas**: Added `replicas: 1` to ensure high availability.

These changes should help improve the reliability and maintainability of your PostgreSQL deployment in Kubernetes.

## Response Analysis
The response is correct. However, an additional question arises:
_A comment is made about **Secret Management**, but not how this can be solved._

So, apply the suggested changes, they are located in file [db-review.yml](sources/db-review.yml).

## Prompt
Open this file and enter a follow-up prompt in the same chat window (this way, the chat memory is sent to the LLM)
```text
the secrets are hardcoded, I want to change this in order to adhere security best practices, what should be changed
```

## Response

---

To adhere to security best practices, you should avoid hardcoding sensitive information like usernames and passwords directly in your YAML files. Instead, use Kubernetes Secrets to manage these credentials securely.

Here's how you can modify your `db.yml` file to use environment variables for the database credentials:

1. **Create a Secret**: First, create a Kubernetes Secret that contains the database credentials.
2. **Update the Deployment**: Use environment variables in the deployment to reference the values from the Secret.

### Step 1: Create a Secret

You can create a Secret using the `kubectl` command or by defining it directly in your YAML file. Here's an example of creating a Secret using `kubectl`:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic demo-db-secret \
  --from-literal=username=user \
  --from-literal=password=pass \
  --from-literal=database=petclinic
```

### Step 2: Update the Deployment

Update your `db.yml` file to use environment variables from the Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: demo-db-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  username: user
  password: pass
  database: petclinic

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: demo-db
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 5432
  selector:
    app: demo-db

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo-db
  labels:
    app: demo-db
spec:
  replicas: 1  # Ensure you have a replica for high availability
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo-db
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo-db
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: postgres:17
          name: postgresql
          env:
            - name: POSTGRES_USER
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: demo-db-secret
                  key: username
            - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: demo-db-secret
                  key: password
            - name: POSTGRES_DB
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: demo-db-secret
                  key: database
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
              name: postgresql
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "64Mi"
              cpu: "250m"
            limits:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 5432
              initialDelaySeconds: 30
              periodSeconds: 10
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 5432
              initialDelaySeconds: 30
              periodSeconds: 10
          startupProbe:
            tcpSocket:
              port: postgresql
              initialDelaySeconds: 10
              periodSeconds: 10
```

### Explanation:

- **Secret Creation**: The `demo-db-secret` Secret is created with the database credentials.
- **Deployment Update**: The deployment now references these credentials using environment variables and `secretKeyRef`.

By following this approach, you ensure that sensitive information is stored securely in Kubernetes Secrets and not exposed directly in your YAML files.

## Response Analysis
The response is correct, although the db.yml file still contains a Secret section with the hardcoded values. This section should have been left out.

So, apply the suggested changes, they are located in file [db-secret.yml](sources/db-secret.yml) and remove the Secrets section.
