# Generate Docker Compose File

Is AI able to convert a docker command in a Docker Compose file?

[Open WebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/) can be started by means of a [docker command](sources/openwebui.sh). Let's see whether the LLM can convert this to a Docker Compose file.

Certainly! Below is a Docker Compose file that you can use to run the `docker-run.sh` command. This file assumes that you have a directory structure where your application files are located.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  open-webui:
    image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
    container_name: open-webui
    ports:
      - "3000:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./backend/data:/app/backend/data
```

### Explanation:
- **version**: Specifies the version of Docker Compose to use.
- **services**: Defines the services that make up your application.
    - **open-webui**: The name of the service.
        - **image**: The Docker image to use, which is `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main`.
        - **container_name**: The name of the container.
        - **ports**: Maps port 8080 inside the container to port 3000 on your host machine.
        - **volumes**: Mounts a volume from your host machine (`./backend/data`) to `/app/backend/data` inside the container.

### Usage:
1. Save the above content into a file named `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Ensure that you have a directory named `backend/data` in the same location as your `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Run the following command in the terminal where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This will start the `open-webui` service in detached mode, and you should be able to access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
