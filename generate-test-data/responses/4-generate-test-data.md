Certainly! Below is an example of SQL commands that you can use to insert 10 different types of pets into your PostgreSQL database:

```sql
INSERT INTO types (name) VALUES ('Dog');
INSERT INTO types (name) VALUES ('Cat');
INSERT INTO types (name) VALUES ('Bird');
INSERT INTO types (name) VALUES ('Fish');
INSERT INTO types (name) VALUES ('Reptile');
INSERT INTO types (name) VALUES ('Small Mammal');
INSERT INTO types (name) VALUES ('Large Mammal');
INSERT INTO types (name) VALUES ('Aquarium Fish');
INSERT INTO types (name) VALUES ('Exotic Bird');
INSERT INTO types (name) VALUES ('Other');
```

These commands will insert 10 different types of pets into the `types` table.
