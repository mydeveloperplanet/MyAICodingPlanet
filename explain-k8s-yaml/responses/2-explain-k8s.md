Sure! Let's break down the terms you asked about:

### Mebibyte (Mi)
A **Mebibyte** (Mi) is a unit of digital information storage. It is equal to 1,048,576 bytes (2^20 bytes). This is different from a Megabyte (MB), which is 1,000,000 bytes.

### RAM and Memory
RAM stands for **Random Access Memory**. It's the temporary storage used by your computer to hold data that programs are currently using. When you run an application, it uses some of this memory to store its data and instructions.

### Converting Mi to Bytes
To convert Mebibytes (Mi) to bytes:
\[ 64 \text{ Mi} = 64 \times 1,048,576 \text{ bytes} = 67,108,864 \text{ bytes} \]

So, **64 Mi** is equivalent to **67,108,864 bytes**.

### Summary:
- **Mebibyte (Mi)**: A unit of digital information storage equal to 1,048,576 bytes.
- **RAM**: The temporary storage used by your computer to hold data that programs are currently using.
- **64 Mi**: Equals 67,108,864 bytes.

This should help you understand the memory requirements specified in your code snippet!
