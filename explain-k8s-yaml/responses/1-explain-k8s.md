Sure! Let's break down the code snippet you provided in simple terms:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

### Explanation:

This code is defining **resource requirements** for a container in a Kubernetes deployment. Think of it like specifying how much power and space the container needs to run smoothly.

#### Requests:
- **memory**: The container asks for 64 MiB (Mebibytes) of memory.
- **cpu**: The container asks for 250 millicores (m) of CPU, which is equivalent to 0.25 cores.

These are like the minimum resources the container needs to start working properly.

#### Limits:
- **memory**: The container can use up to 128 MiB of memory.
- **cpu**: The container can use up to 500 millicores (m) of CPU, which is equivalent to 0.5 cores.

These are like the maximum resources the container can use before it might start running into performance issues or be stopped by Kubernetes if it exceeds these limits.

### Summary:
- **Requests** tell Kubernetes how much resource the container needs.
- **Limits** tell Kubernetes how much resource the container is allowed to use.

This helps ensure that your application runs efficiently and doesn't consume too many resources, which could affect other applications on the same machine.
